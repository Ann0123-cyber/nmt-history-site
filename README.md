Website for preparing for the exam in the history of Ukraine!

This website was developed as a coursework project to provide interactive preparation for the Ukrainian national exam (ZNO/NMT) in history. It is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The goal of the site is to help students efficiently practice historical knowledge through various test formats aligned with the official curriculum, including dates, historical figures, cultural landmarks, and a mixed test mode.
Results from date tests are cached in local storage, allowing users to track their progress. The historical figures test supports two modes: priority (important first) and chronological (older figures first). The architectural monuments page allows you to sort monuments by architectural style and search for architectural monuments with debounce and AbortController.
Laboratory work from the first to the seventh of the subject Programming Fundamentals was integrated in this work.
This project was created by Musiiovska Anna as a coursework submission in 2025!
